# Quadratic Nth Term Calculator
This is a program I made to show ada sixth-form during my interview, to hopefully get accepted.  The program will calculate the formula for any quadratic sequence using the algebra method. (This is my first proper program in Java!)

Install the Executables folder if you would like to run the program. The jar file is for any device or operating system; it requires the Java Runtime Environment.
To run the file, go to command prompt, cd into the jar file's directory, and run the command: 
java -jar "Quadratic Nth Term Calculator.jar". If you're on windows, you can simply run the batch file (it must be in the same directory/folder as the jar file).
